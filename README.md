## Hey there! 

I’m [**Dima**](https://www.zhogind.online), ML engineer from Saint Petersburg.

I do AI stuff and some other web/linux development occasionally.

My main tech stack is PyTorch, Langchain, Pandas, Docker, FastAPI. When it comes to web development, I use React and Tailwind the most.

~For now, Omarchy Linux is my main os, but I like changing Linux distros from time to time and have already tried quite a few, Fedora being my favourite.~ Switched to MacOS:)

Professionally, I've been working on NLP solutions for buisiness and satellite calculation software.
